## results.mat
This is just the results computed for A_bfgs and c_bfgs for N=55.
I saved this because it took me about 8 hours to compute this. We can use this to carry out the computation for the Newton method without going through BFGS again.

## choreographies.mat
The codes are FULLY WORKING now. It's slow but I have verified that it is correct. After running all the codes, the important results are the variables A_bfgs, c_bfgs, A_newton, c_newton.
