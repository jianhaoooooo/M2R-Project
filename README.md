This part is not fully done yet as I cannot evaluate the integral and I do not completely understand the structure of the function. This part is currently contained in the Choreographies.m file.

## gradhessian
This is completely working. However, I have not verify if there is any error contained in the code itself.
This function takes in the input arguments of (c, n, N, w) where c is a 2N vector [u1, u2, ..., uN, v1, v2, ..., vN], n is the number of bodies, N is the number of BFGS Fourier Coefficients and set w=0 for absolute choreography.
